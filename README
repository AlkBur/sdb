disk storage based on cdb code

linked lists from r2 api

Changes:
--------
I have slightly modified the cdb code to get smaller databases
and be memory leak free.

The sdb's cdb database format is 10% smaller than the original
one. This is because keylen and valuelen are encoded in 4 bytes
using two endian-safe unsigned short values.

In a test case, a 4.3MB cdb database takes only 3.9MB after the
file format change.

Backups:
--------
To make a backup of a database to move it between different boxes use the textual format:
 $ sdb my.db > my.txt
 $ gzip my.txt
 $ du -hs my.*
 my.db        3.9M
 my.txt.gz    500K

To import the database:
  $ zcat my.txt.gz | sdb my.db =
