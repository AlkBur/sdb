TODO
----
* Create json api (see src/json/README)
* Add support for socket file for memcached api
* incr returns char * in mcsdb and ut64 in sdb api? looks wrong!
* add api to create db without caching it before
* remove buffer

Syncronization
--------------
 - each key/value have a timestamp of creation/modification
 - sdb_diff() must check both databases and look for removed entries
 - sincronization between hosts - realtime storage
 - run sync every N seconds?

Optimization
------------
* remove endian conversions
* use slices instead of mallocs
* implement udp protocol for memcache
* use 16 bit key and 16 bit value
* use kernel's linked list? it should be faster..

BUGS
----
* hashtable is not cleaned up when sync
  - must honor expire time entries
* key and value boundaries are probably not properly handled
