SDB :: Simple DataBase
======================
* Add api to create db without caching it before
* Remove endian conversions
* KeyValue must be 4 bytes (smaller footprint, faster write)
  1 byte for key length
  3 bytes for value length
* remove buffer
* TODO: count items in list?
  - use kernel's linked list?

Syncronization
--------------
 - each key/value have a timestamp of creation/modification
 - sdb_diff() must check both databases and look for removed entries
 - sincronization between hosts - realtime storage
 - server can be running with sync every N secs
