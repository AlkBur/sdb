SDB :: Simple DataBase
======================
* Add api to create db without caching it before
* Remove endian conversions
* remove buffer
* TODO: count items in list?
  - use kernel's linked list?

Syncronization
--------------
 - each key/value have a timestamp of creation/modification
 - sdb_diff() must check both databases and look for removed entries
 - sincronization between hosts - realtime storage
 - server can be running with sync every N secs

Optimization
------------
* use slices instead of mallocs
* implement udp protocol for memcache
* use 16 bit key and 16 bit value

BUGS
----
* hashtable is not cleaned up when sync
  - must honor expire time entries
